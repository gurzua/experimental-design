# Experimental Design in Python
## 📖 Overview

This repository provides practical Python implementations of experimental design concepts, with a strong focus on correct randomization, statistical validity, and reproducibility.

The goal is to bridge the gap between experimental theory and real-world data analysis, using clear, well-documented examples and notebooks.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of experimental design
- Implement random assignment and blocking strategies in Python
- Validate experiment integrity (e.g. balance checks, SRM detection)
- Apply appropriate statistical tests for inference
- Interpret results correctly and avoid common pitfalls

---

### 🧪 Topics Covered

- Random assignment of experimental units
- Blocking and stratified randomization
- Completely randomized vs blocked designs
- A/B testing fundamentals
- Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) detection
- Balance checks across treatment groups
- Hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square)
- Effect size estimation
- Assumptions and diagnostics

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

The project relies primarily on:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib / seaborn
- pingouin (for statistical testing)
